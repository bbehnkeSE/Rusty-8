# Rusty-8

Rusty-8 is an attempt at recreating a C++ Chip-8 emulator by Austin Morlan ([https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/)) in Rust.

The functionality of the emulator should be in place, all that remains is to create a window and draw the pixels to the screen.
